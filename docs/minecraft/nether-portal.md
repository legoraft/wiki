# Nether portals

Nether portals are used in Minecraft to travel between the nether and the overworld. In the nether every block traveled is 8 blocks horizontally, so you can use the nether to travel faster in the overworld.

## 2-in-1 portal

Besides traveling fast, you can also do something funky with a nether portal: You can create a single portal that teleports you to two locations. I've written this out in case it's ever helpful.
