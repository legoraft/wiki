# ZSH

Zsh is a shell that's used by default on MacOS and my preferred shell on Linux. This documentation gives some extra information on configuring zsh.

## .zshrc

The main configuration file of zsh is within the `.zshrc`. This file is mostly located within the home directory. Most of this file works in the same way like a `.bashrc` works, it just runs commands at startup of a new session.
