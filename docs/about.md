# About

I'm Legoraft, someone who likes to play games and tinker around with computers. I try to self host some services I like and try to make my linux install as pretty and efficient as possible.

I'm currently daily driving pop os, which is still on Ubuntu 22.04, but I'm planning on switching to Debian testing in the near future. My server does run Debian stable and runs some other services I self host.
