# Info

I have a small homelab setup with a minecraft server, jellyfin server and a web server which hosts this wiki. On these pages you can find some info on how I run my servers and what I do to manage them and use them.

## Managing

I manage my servers through a vpn, which prevents management tools being exposed to the internet. Some of the services I run are exposed to the internet, but through a reverse proxy for added security. I've set up this reverse proxy with [Nginx](/nginx), which is quite simple and allows https.
