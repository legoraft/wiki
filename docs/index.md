# Home

This is the homepage for my wiki. I have some hacky stuff and info on how to use the things I use daily.

Most of my hobbies are computer related, I have a minecraft server and run Linux on most of my machines. I recently started hosting jellyfin, so some of the things in this wiki relate to that.

This wiki is hosted through github pages and works great. I want to test some stuff however.
