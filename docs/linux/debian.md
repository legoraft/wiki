# Debian

This is a wiki page about [Debian](https://debian.org). I am aiming to use this distro for personal use, but I'm using it for my servers currently. To use it for a server without a monitor, you have to [preseed](debian.md/#preseeding) it, which is a somewhat difficult process. I've documented it in this wiki.
