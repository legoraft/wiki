# Dockge

Dockge is a simple way to manage and view your docker containers. You can see the logging within the dashboard and write all your docker compose files within the web interface. It is my preferred way to start any docker container and manage it. Because it is a powerful tool, I'd recommend to only have it accessible on the home network.
